I developped Simple Audio Manager as a way to have access to a quick audio manager for game jams and then decided to release it as a plugin.

The plugin auto adds an Audio autoload.

All that is needed is to create AudioFile resources with your, well, audio files, and then use these AudioFile in your script with the Audio autoload.

Example: Audio.play(my_audio_file)
